           Best time to visit Chhattisgarh
         </h1>
        
         <p>Best time to visit Chhattisgarh is during the winter season, i.e. between November and February when the weather is pleasant and comfortable for the tourists to visit all the tourist attractions. Chhattisgarh is least recommended during summer as the temperature can hit a maximum of 45°C, making it an incredibly inconvenient option to travel to the state. Heavy rainfall and high humidity levels are experienced during the monsoons which may not be what most tourists are looking for. </p>
