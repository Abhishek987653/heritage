A collection of performing arts have originated here including dance, music, and drama. Dance is the most important kind of performing art which is why it has always been encouraged by people to be followed ever since the age of dawn. Kuchipudi is one of the most famous dance forms which is also recognized as one of the best kind of dance forms in the world. Kuchipudi undoubtedly has some similarities with another dance form that is, Bharat Natyam.

    <h4>Melodious Music</h4>

     <p>Andhra Pradesh has always been known for its rich musical heritage. This land has given birth to three legends in the world of Carnatic music namely Shyama Sastri, Thyagaraja and Muthuswami Dixtar. Since the Telugu language is spoken by most people in the state, it is, therefore, able to bring out the originality and the true spirit of the Carnatic music. Some famous Carnatic music composers include Kshetrayya, Annamacharya and Bhadrachala Ramadasa. This type of music is also said to be begun by the Holy Gods. Another very famous kind of music which has said to be originated from Carnatic music is folk music. This art has been passed on to the descendants over the years. Every music has a distinctive feature meaning that every composition of music has a different version altogether. The musical element and the hidden meaning behind the song is what makes it more meaningful and attractive. Another feature which separates the Carnatic music from the rest of the music is the fact that the song is always able to bring out the personality of the song composer completely thereby increasing the level of the language in the music.</p>
